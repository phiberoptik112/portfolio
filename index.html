            <p>I am a experienced signal processing engineer with a passion for creating data driven interpretations of complex data. I love turning ideas into reality through code.</p>

                <h3>Acoustics ASTM Test Report Generator</h3>
                <p>I created a Python GUI and processing script backend that generates ASTM test reports from ASTC, AIIC, NIC, and DTC acoustics tests. The script processes sound level data combines them with the test environment aspects to generate a report with the results of the test. This is replacing a manual entry excel spreadsheet and reduces the test data processing and report generation and formatting time from hours to minutes.</p>

                <h3> Airpods Max: Pressure Relief Vent Production line Tester</h3>
                <p>During the prototype hardware development phase of Airpods Max, the primary pressure relief vent for the speaker frontvolume was shown to produce a tone when airflow was introduced. I was tasked with finding the root cause of this issue and creating a production line tester to validate the solution. This was a critical project for the Airpods Max launch and I was able to find the root cause and create a solution that was implemented in the production line to validate the solution.</p>
                <p>The fix primarily consisted of developing a frequency analysis technique of Q-factor measurement of a tone produced when air was forced through the pressure relief vent. </p>
                <p>For more details about the development process and implementation of this test station, you can view my detailed presentation:</p>

                <h3>Matlab Headphone Response Tools</h3>
                <p>During my time at Apple, writing Matlab recording tools was essential for processing frequency response data and drawing conclusions from comparing that data to different hardware configurations. I've created various small import tools that interface with proprietary development devices and prototype firmware to record and process data.</p>
                <p> This process would be crucial throughout development and into the different production phases to ensure performance targets were met. </p>

        <h3>ASTM Test Report Generator</h3>
        <p>This is the GUI front-end for the ASTM test report generator. It takes in the raw sound level meter data and a specifically formatted test plan to calculate results per the ASTM standards and output a formatted report.</p>
