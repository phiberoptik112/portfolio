            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a experienced signal processing and acoustics engineer with a passion for creating data driven interpretations of complex engineering problems and designs. My most impactful work has focused on the collection, analysis, and and implementation of data to either inform designs or identify and solve problems. </p>
            <p>The work I enjoy the most are when design and its implementation meet. I consistently thrive in scenarios where uncertainty is inherent, and I thoroughly enjoy the process of understanding complex problems objectively.</p>

                <h3>Acoustics ASTM Test Report Generator</h3>
                <p>I created a Python GUI and processing script backend that generates ASTM test reports from ASTC, AIIC, NIC, and DTC acoustics tests. The script processes sound level data combines them with the test environment aspects to generate a report with the results of the test. This is replacing a manual entry excel spreadsheet and reduces the test data processing and report generation and formatting time from hours to minutes.</p>
                <p>For more details about the development process and implementation of this test station, you can view my deep dive Overview:</p>

                <h3> Airpods Max: Pressure Relief Vent Production Line Tester</h3>
                <p>During the hardware development phase of Airpods Max, the primary pressure relief vent for the speaker front-volume was shown to produce a tone when airflow was introduced. I was tasked with finding the root cause of this issue and creating a production line tester to validate the solution. This was a critical project for the Airpods Max launch and I was able to find the root cause and create a solution that was implemented in the production line to validate the solution.</p>
                <p>The fix primarily consisted of developing a frequency analysis technique of Q-factor measurement of a tone produced when air was forced through the pressure relief vent. </p>

        <h3>ASTM Test Report Generator</h3>
        <p>This is the GUI front-end for the ASTM test report generator. It takes in the raw sound level meter data and a specifically formatted test plan to calculate results per the ASTM standards and output a formatted report.</p>
